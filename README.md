# reactive-dev-days-lab

A reactive version of the [Xamarin dev-days-lab](https://github.com/xamarin/dev-days-labs) using [ReactiveUI](http://reactiveui.net/). Uses XAML bindings.

Demonstrates the use of project.json and .NET Standard with Xamarin.Forms, thanks to the posts ["project.json all the things"](https://oren.codes/2016/02/08/project-json-all-the-things/) and ["Using Xamarin Forms with .NET Standard"](https://oren.codes/?s=xamarin+standard) by Oren Novotny.
