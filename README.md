# reactive-dev-days-lab

A reactive version of the [Xamarin dev-days-lab](https://github.com/xamarin/dev-days-labs). 

Demonstrates the following:

- [ReactiveUI](http://reactiveui.net/) MVVM.
- XAML bindings.
- [ViewModel-based routing](https://docs.reactiveui.net/en/user-guide/routing/).
- .NET Standard use with Xamarin.Forms, thanks to the posts ["project.json all the things"](https://oren.codes/2016/02/08/project-json-all-the-things/) and ["Using Xamarin Forms with .NET Standard"](https://oren.codes/?s=xamarin+standard) by Oren Novotny.
